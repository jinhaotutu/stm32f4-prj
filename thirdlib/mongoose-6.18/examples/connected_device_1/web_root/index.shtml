    <h1>Connected device demo - static content only</h1>

    <p>
      This page shows initial steps on how to make a device connected.
      Mongoose serves static content from the <code>web_root</code>
      directory. Images, CSS, HTML, JavaScript files could be dropped into the
      <code>web_root</code> directory - and they'll be served happily
      by Mongoose.
    </p>

    <p>
      Below is a placeholder for the
      settings section, and a real-time dashboard, which will be
      implemented in the following examples.
      Both settings section, and a dashboard section, could be organised
      differently on this UI - for example, in different tabs. But, to
      make the demonstration clearer, we show everything on one page.
