Mongoose is a networking library for C/C++. It implements event-driven
non-blocking APIs for TCP, UDP, HTTP, WebSocket, MQTT.  It has been designed
for connecting devices and bringing them online. On the market since 2004, used
by vast number of open source and commercial products - it even runs on the
International Space Station!  Mongoose makes embedded network programming fast,
robust, and easy.
